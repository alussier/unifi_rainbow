Cycles the Unifi Dream Router RGB LED through a rainbow patttern

generated by chatgpt o3-mini-high

I've requested the GPL sources for the kernel from Ubiquiti.  I plan to build a kernel with `ftrace` enabled, sniff the I2C commands that drive the LED colors, and re-writing this as either my own kernel module, or a userspace utility to directly send the needed I2C commands (I don't like that the stock module is logging to dmesg every color update)
